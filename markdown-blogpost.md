# A day in the life...

Today started like any other day. Actually that's not what happen _at all_. Today was the second day of my new coding bootcamp so instead of waking up at 11 am like i have been doing, I am now getting up at 8 am. Let me tell you, it's **QUITE** the adjustment. Although they're early mornings I do enjoy getting to spend more time at home with my animals.

## My mornings usually go something like this:

- Wake Up
- Take the dogs out
- Eat breakfast
- Log on and prep for my morning stand up

## Lunchtime

For lunch I usually eat a PB&J, Here's how I make mine:

1. Spread peanut butter on one piece of bread
2. Spread jelly on the **SAME SIDE** as the peanut butter
3. Cover with other slice of bread
4. Cut into triangles and enjoy!

After lunch, I pair program the rest of the day and keep track of all my code with my GitHub Acct.
